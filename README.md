We present Representation Autoencoders (RAE), a class of autoencoders that utilize  pretrained, frozen representation encoders such as [DINOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193) and [SigLIP2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14786) as encoders with trained ViT decoders. RAE can be used in a two-stage training pipeline for high-fidelity image synthesis, where a Stage 2 diffusion model is trained on the latent space of a pretrained RAE to generate images.

This branch contains:

TorchXLA/TPU:
* A TPU implementation of RAE and pretrained weights.
* Sampling of RAE and DiT<sup>DH</sup> on TPU.

## Environment

### Dependency Setup
1. Create environment and install via `uv`:
   ```bash
   conda create -n rae python=3.10 -y
   conda activate rae
   pip install uv
   
   # Install PyTorch 2.2.0 with CUDA 12.1
   uv pip install torch~=2.5.0 torch_xla[tpu]~=2.5.0 torchvision==0.20.1 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/libtpu-releases/index.html
   
   # Install other dependencies
   uv pip install timm==0.9.16 accelerate==0.23.0 torchdiffeq==0.2.5 wandb
   uv pip install "numpy<2" transformers einops
   ```

## Data & Model Preparation

### Download Pre-trained Models

We release three kind of models: RAE decoders, DiT<sup>DH</sup> diffusion transformers and stats for latent normalization. To download all models at once:


```bash

cd RAE
pip install huggingface_hub
hf download nyu-visionx/RAE-collections \
  --local-dir models 
```


To download specific models, run:
```bash
hf download nyu-visionx/RAE-collections \
  <remote_model_path> \
  --local-dir models 
```

### Prepare Dataset

1. Download ImageNet-1k.
2. Point Stage 1 and Stage 2 scripts to the training split via `--data-path`.


## Config-based Initialization

All training and sampling entrypoints are driven by OmegaConf YAML files. A
single config describes the Stage 1 autoencoder, the Stage 2 diffusion model,
and the solver used during training or inference. A minimal example looks like:

```yaml
stage_1:
   target: stage1.RAE
   params: { ... }
   ckpt: <path_to_ckpt>  

stage_2:
   target: stage2.models.DDT.DiTwDDTHead
   params: { ... }
   ckpt: <path_to_ckpt>  

transport:
   params:
      path_type: Linear
      prediction: velocity
      ...
sampler:
   mode: ODE
   params:
      num_steps: 50
      ...
guidance:
   method: cfg/autoguidance
   scale: 1.0
   ...
misc:
   latent_size: [768, 16, 16]
   num_classes: 1000
training:
   ...
```

- `stage_1` instantiates the frozen encoder and trainable decoder. For Stage 1
  training you can point to an existing checkpoint via `stage_1.ckpt` or start
  from `pretrained_decoder_path`.
- `stage_2` defines the diffusion transformer. During sampling you must provide
  `ckpt`; during training you typically omit it so weights initialise randomly.
- `transport`, `sampler`, and `guidance` select the forward/backward SDE/ODE
  integrator and optional classifier-free or autoguidance schedule.
- `misc` collects shapes, class counts, and scaling constants used by both
  stages.
- `training` contains defaults that the training scripts consume (epochs,
  learning rate, EMA decay, gradient accumulation, etc.).

Stage 1 training configs additionally include a top-level `gan` block that
configures the discriminator architecture and the LPIPS/GAN loss schedule.


### Provided Configs:

#### Stage1

We release decoders for DINOv2-B, SigLIP-B, MAE-B, at `configs/stage1/pretrained/`.

There is also a training script for training a ViT-XL decoder on DINOv2-B: `configs/stage1/training/DINOv2-B_decXL.yaml`

#### Stage2

We release our best model, DiT<sup>DH</sup>-XL and it's guidance model on both $256\times 256$ and $512\times 512$, at `configs/stage2/sampling/`.

We also provide training configs for DiT<sup>DH</sup> at `configs/stage2/training/`.

## Stage 1: Representation Autoencoder

### Sampling/Reconstruction

Use `src/stage1_sample.py` to encode/decode a single image:

```bash
python src/stage1_sample.py \
  --config <config> \
  --image assets/pixabay_cat.png \
```

For batched reconstructions and `.npz` export, run the XLA native DDP variant:

```bash
  python src/stage1_sample_ddp.py \
  --config <config> \
  --data-path <imagenet_val_split> \
  --sample-dir recon_samples \
  --image-size 256
```

The script writes per-image PNGs as well as a packed `.npz` suitable for FID.

## Stage 2: Latent Diffusion Transformer


For sampling, XLA branch only supports a manually implemented Euler sampler as `torchdiffeq` is not compatible with TPU.

### Sampling

`src/sample.py` uses the same config schema to draw a small batch of images on a
single device and saves them to `sample.png`:

```bash
python src/sample.py \
  --config <sample_config> \
  --seed 42
```


### Distributed sampling for evaluation

`src/sample_ddp.py` parallelises sampling across TPU cores, producing PNGs and an
FID-ready `.npz`:

```bash
python src/sample_ddp.py \
  --config <sample_config> \
  --sample-dir samples \
  --precision bf16 \
  --label-sampling equal
```
`--label-sampling {equal,random}`: `equal` uses exactly 50 images per class for FID-50k; `random` uniformly samples labels. Using `equal` brings consistently lower FID than `random` by around 0.1. We use `equal` by default.

Autoguidance and classifier-free guidance are controlled via the config’s
`guidance` block.

## Evaluation

### ADM Suite FID setup (only available on GPU)

Use GPU with the ADM evaluation suite to score generated samples. You need to port the npz file generated from TPU to a GPU machine.

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion.git
   cd guided-diffusion/evaluation
   ```

2. Create an environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   conda create -n adm-fid python=3.10
   conda activate adm-fid
   pip install 'tensorflow[and-cuda]'==2.19 scipy requests tqdm
   ```

3. Download ImageNet statistics (256×256 shown here):

   ```bash
   wget https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/diffusion/jul-2021/ref_batches/imagenet/256/VIRTUAL_imagenet256_labeled.npz
   ```

4. Evaluate:

   ```bash
   python evaluator.py VIRTUAL_imagenet256_labeled.npz /path/to/samples.npz
   ```
